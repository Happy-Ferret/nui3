Using the nui stylesheets, a graphic dressing runtime-system, it’s easy to make your application look good. \r\nIt's much like web CSS: artists are our friends! \r\n\r\n### Don’t waste time on low-level system issues.\r\nnui brings you strings (including unicode), paths, files, data streams, fonts, threads, critical sections, audio buffer rendering, and more...\r\n\r\n### Embeddable\r\nCreating plugins for other applications? nui has been designed to do it from the very beginning. Professional nui based AudioUnits, VST, VSTi, ProTools, MAS, DirectX and Maya plugins have been successfully created over the years.\r\n\r\n### Not just a new kid on the block.\r\nnui was started on the eve of the 21st century and has always been actively developed since then. It is mature and has a nice track record of successful products. The dev team is working full time with nui, adding exciting new features and fixing bugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tips\r\n* You can go to our development & documentation web site to get the lastest info and subscribe to the mailing lists. \r\n* An nui project generator, for Xcode and Visual Studio, can be found in the Yapuka application, in the tools folder of the source code directory. You will save some time using it. \r\n* Several sample programs can be found in the tutorials folder of the source code directory. They will help you to understand how to develop an nui application. \r\n* You can check out the Wiki section of the development & documentation web site. You will find usefull documentation to get started.\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n* Sébastien Métrot (co author of ngl, author of nui) \r\n* Vincent Caron (most ngl* classes are his design and code so more like a co-author than a contrib) \r\n* Vincent Bongiorno \r\n* Loïc Berthelot \r\n* Charles Françoise \r\n* Charles Huet \r\n* Sebastien Le Breton \r\n* Matthieu Campion \r\n* Mathieu Champlon \r\n* Marc Barilley \r\n* Olivier Tristan \r\n* Jérôme Blondon \r\n* Mathieu Garcia \r\n* Gaël Levavasseur \r\n* David Wallin\r\n\r\n### We extend our thanks to the following companies who permited their engineers to contribute to NUI:\r\n\r\n* Ultimate Sound Bank \r\n* Musinaut/Mxp4 \r\n* INTUA \r\n* IVS \r\n* White Noise Audio Software\r\n"}
